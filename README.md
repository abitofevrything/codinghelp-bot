This is a bot that I created and decided to make it open-source. I get assistance from my awesome discord server when it comes to updates and fixing bugs.

## Contributions
I love getting contributions. All you have to do is join the [r/CodingHelp Discord Server](https://codinghelp.site/discord) and you can make suggestions and help contribute to the bots success!
