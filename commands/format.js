It is next to your number 1 key on your keyboard.\n\nIf you have a single line of code, you will want to use a single backtick around your code like so: \\`<img src="image source here" alt="alt text here" />\\`\n\nIf you have multiple lines of code (2 or more) you will want to use 3 backticks around your code like so:\n``````\n<html>\nextra code here...\nanother line here...\n</html>\n\u17b5`\u17b5`\u17b5`\u17b5```\nThis outputs this:\n```<html>\nextra code here...\nanother line here...\n</html>```\nAlso, highlight the syntax, after the first 3 backticks you will write the type of code it is, like HTML, JavaScript, Java, Bat (for batch files), etcetera.
